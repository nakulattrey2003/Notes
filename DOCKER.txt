Docker

Meaning and Use:
    Suppose you are running a website that you had made on your desktop and your friend wants to run the same 
    website on his desktop then he must have the same configurations and versions that you computer has.
    As this is not possible for a single as well as a large group of people so there comes docker to help you.

    The docker is like a box which contains all you configurations and that can be duplicated or send over multiple
    devices, so that people who want the same configurations can use that. These boxes are light weight and are
    easily transferable.
