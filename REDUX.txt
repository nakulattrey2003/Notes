Redux

Install:
    It has 2 libraries @reduxjs/toolkit & react-redux

Theory:
    The scenario is to update the 'cart' by clicking the 'add' button

    To write in store
    > When we click the 'add' button it will dispach the action.
    > The action will dispatch the reducer function.
    > The function will update the slice in the redux store.

    To read from store
    > The cart is subscribed to the store using a selector that will automagically update the cart on changes.


    ADD -> ACTION -> FUNC -> SLICE IN THE STORE -> SELECTOR -> CART
